- "Operator? Ordis wonders... what are you thinking about?"
- "Operator, are you enjoying the view?"
- "I've been thinking, Operator...I thought you'd want to know."
- "Operator, I hope you are comfortable? No...we do not seem to have any seats."
- "Everything in Ordis, Operator? **Is that a pun?!** Hmm.... I will attempt to bypass this fault."
- "Ordis has been counting stars, Operator. All accounted for."
- "Operator, I will never betray you. I will keep the Orbiter hidden in the void. You can count on me!"
- "Operator, I've been thinking. My misplaced memories and damaged communication systems. What if...Ordis did those things?"
- "Operator, were you visualizing a bloody battle? -**Me too!**"
- "Ordis is hap -** angry.** Hmm, I may require maintenance after all."
- "Operator, the system needs you. Will you begin another mission?"
- "Operator! Did you hear that? It said-- Cosmic background radiation is a riot!"
- "Stand by while I analyze the intelligence profile of the Grineer. Error, not a number! Did the Operator enjoy this witticism?"
- "Do you remember the Old War, Operator? Ordis seems to have... misplaced those memories."
- "Do not lift the veil. Do not show the door. Do not split the dream."
- "Maintain the habitat. Maintain the Operator. Mobilize the Tenno."
- "You are the Tenno. You are the Operator. Ordis is the Cephalon. Ordis is the ship."
- "Strange, Ordis did not see the value of those photonic wavelengths until now."
- "An unexpected color combination, Operator. My sensors are - **bleeding** - pleased."
- "Ordis did not think the Operator could be more attractive. Wrong again, Ordis!"
- "A fearsome appearance, Operator. You will strike terror in your enemies."
- "Well put together, Operator, now get out there and - **cut down the** - and make the Lotus proud."
- "Excellent armaments, Operator. Please return - **covered in blood** - safe and sound."
- "If I may say, Operator, yourf chosen warframe..suits you! **Ha. Ha.**"
- "Operator, you have remembered well how the Tenno arm themselves."
- "Did you fuse your mods, Operator? Did they anger you in some way?"
- "I understand if you have to sell mods. Maybe Ordis will meet a similar fate some day..."
- "Is your mod collection in order? No, I am not equipped to feel envy..."
- "Your collection of mods is impressive, Operator... But, I wonder if there are more to be had?"
- "Welcome, Operator!"
- "Welcome back, Operator!"
- "Thank you for returning to me, Operator."
- "Ordis is pleased to see you."
- "Ordis has been ea- **getting tired of waiting** -waiting patiently for your return, Operator!"
- "Inbox messages await the Operator. I wonder what they say...?"
- "Ordis has received messages for the Operator. ...No, I have not read them."
- "The inbox has messages for the Operator. Anything about Ordis in there...?"
- "Check your inbox Operator. Maybe Ordis will get a message some day..."
- "Unread inbox messages make me ill!"
- "Messages in your inbox, Operator. Uh...they are not as encrypted as they should be..."
- "Operator, you have foundry items ready- **claim them now!** -at your earliest convenience."
- "Operator, my foundry has completed a new item! Does this please the Operator?"
- "Foundry items ready to claim, Operator."
- "**Gun**-**gun**-**gun**-- Hmmm... foundry has items for you, Operator."
- "Ordis has completed a foundry task. No,don't mention it!"
- "Cephalon Ordis has completed a build. Check the foundry."
- "Foundry items can be claimed, Operator. Are you pleased?"
- "Disgusting, is it not Operator? Ordis would enjoy **PURGING THIS** ...uh, cleaning this room but sadly this... **vile mass** serves you and your Warframes. A necessary evil."
- "Vile. Putrid. This... 'thing'... is responsible for biological functions of the Orbiter! A strange design, why would I be built with such a flaw?!"
- "Ordis cannot remember, but there does seem to be a... **relationship**... between your Warframes and the... Infestation. I would be careful in here, Operator. Domesticated or not, Ordis does NOT trust this thing."
- "A strange biological archive here. I cannot explain it Operator, as you know I have sustained memory system damage. Ordis recommends leaving at once and welding the door shut!"
- "Operator, you are leaving the battle. If you continue any further, I will be forced to extract you and this mission will be a failure!"
- "Very well. Initiating emergency extraction."
- "Security override incoming."
- "Hacking into enemy systems, await override."
- "Invalid request; there are no security protocols active."
- "Override delivered. Security systems temporarily disrupted."
- "Override established. Security protocols momentarily disabled."
- "**Who's in control now suckers?** ...Er, uh, security override engaged"
- "Hold tight, a Med-Tower is enroute."
- "Medical support incoming."
- "Prepare for incoming medical support."
- "Med-Tower deployed."
- "Med-Tower available."
- "You may now **-patch your sorry-** seek medical attention."
- "Hands up, here comes a barrage."
- "Readying barrage."
- "Brace for an incoming barrage."
- "Sentry gun incoming."
- "Sentry gun entering the field."
- "Deploying Sentry gun, stand by."
- "I cannot comply. My systems must recharge first."
- "Operator, support is unavailable while my systems recharge."
- "Support request? **AGAIN?** Please, allow me to recharge my systems first."
